# EarlyBird

## Update

Earlybird is moving to a new url -> https://earlybird.flanny.com
And a new tech stack
- Twitter API
- Auth 0
- Netlify

## Legacy

EarlyBird was a tweet scheduling program that allowed users to draft and schedule tweets for the future. There are other options available online that accomplish the same goal, but none had a UI or price that I liked. Twitter has since improved thier draft and scheduling interface, so paying to keep this project online was not worth it.
